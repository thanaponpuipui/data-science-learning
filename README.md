## Data science and machine learning introduction project

This project keep tracking practice and experiment of me learn data science.
most of the practice are from ztm-ml course.

================================================================================================
### tools

- Pandas => data analysis and manipulation.
- Numpy => for fast and optimized array, fundamental to scientific computing.
- Matplotlib => visualizing the data.
- scikit-learn => model for maching learning.
- Jupyter Notebook => workspace. good for data science project.
also using miniconda (mini version of Anaconda) and conda as project manager.

================================================================================================
### step

- First focusing on learning what data science and maching learning are about. [O]
- Learn to use the popular tools and understand why people are using them. [^]
  - Jupyter Notebook [^]
  - Pandas [O]
  - Numpy []
  - Matplotlib []
  - scikit-learn []
- Structured data. (follow the course)
- Doing my own project.
- Machine learning things with TensorFlow.

================================================================================================
### goal

1. Understand the workflow and tool used in data science project.
2. finish a project with trained A.I. with any accuracy and speed.
3. know how to plan and set goal of the ml project and actually finish the project

I will also build other projects to collect and generate data, that may be use in this project.
